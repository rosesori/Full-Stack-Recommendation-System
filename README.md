This repository was transferred from my school GitHub account originally, and so the commit histories cannot be shown here.

My main contributions can be found in databasePopulation/population_script.java and analyticsGUI.java.
My intentions to add the code here was to showcase my code styling and organization line-to-line, which I am proud of.
